/* Solar System Order — eight levels of putting things where they belong.

   Level 1  the eight planets, in order out from the Sun
   Level 2  the moons a child is likely to have heard of, onto their planet
   Level 3  moons a spaceship has flown past and photographed
   Level 4  more of the same -- every one of these has a resolved surface
   Level 5  little moons among the rings; none has ever been resolved
   Level 6  more moons nobody has seen as anything but a point
   Level 7  the far-out moons, on wide, slow, tilted orbits
   Level 8  the dwarf planets, in order, and then their moons

   Levels 3 to 7 are split by whether anyone has ever SEEN the moon -- the
   2026-09-06 owner decision, and the one idea here a child will not get from a
   video. See the note above LEVELS. This header said "four levels" and listed
   the pre-2026-09-06 shape until 2026-09-06; it is the first thing anyone reads,
   so it is worth keeping true.

   The game asks and the child answers. Level 1 asks for one planet at a time in
   order -- the ring it is asking about blinks, the question names what it wants,
   and a single tap on the right planet sends it home. That is the owner's call
   (2026-08-20): a child should be able to play by clicking, in order, without
   first having to know that ring 4 means Mars. Dragging still works for anyone
   who prefers it, but nothing needs it.

   Sizes and positions in the data below are for a 1024px-wide stage and scale
   from there. Sound is synthesised in WebAudio; spoken lines, when they exist,
   are pre-rendered files listed in narration/clips.json. Neither is ever

/* The five the IAU recognises, in NASA's own order out from the Sun: Ceres in
   the asteroid belt and four beyond Neptune. Ordering them by average distance is
   what makes the order stable -- these orbits are stretched, and Pluto is nearer
   the Sun than Neptune for twenty years at a time -- and it is the order NASA
   prints.

   They are NOT eight-plus-five. Pluto does not join level 1, and no level ever
   calls it a planet: the storybook's page 19 is careful that Pluto is still a
   real world and that "dwarf planet" is a group it belongs to, not a demotion out
   of existence, and a game that slid it into "put the planets in order" would
   teach exactly the thing that page refuses to.

   Level 5 has its own board for the same reason. Eris averages sixty-eight times
   the Earth's distance from the Sun against Neptune's thirty, so putting the
   thirteen on one set of rings would need a made-up scale that quietly said Eris
   is just past Neptune. Its own board, and each one's own words for where it
   lives, tells the truth instead.

   `d` is again compressed but truly ordered: Pluto is widest, then Eris, then
   Haumea's long axis, then Makemake, then Ceres. */

   `order` is a roster to be put in place from the Sun outwards, one body at a

   moons instead. A level may do both: level 5 orders the five dwarf planets and
   then gives Pluto its moon, which is why the mode lives in `state.mode` and not
   in the level number.

     will not get from a video. Levels 3 and 4 are moons a spacecraft resolved:
     they have craters, cliffs and colours, and their sprites carry markings.
     Levels 5, 6 and 7 are moons no instrument has ever resolved: they are
     points of light, and their sprites are plain tinted lumps. The child can
     see the difference on the deck before anyone explains it.

     The split also answers the owner's complaint about the old level 4, which
     asked ten consecutive questions whose answer was always Uranus: "if the
     game is just click on the same planet throughout the level, it is not fun."

   The owner heard it on the moons (2026-08-21). Level 1's planet facts, the

   is home!" -- all had the same defect.

   Polling rather than the element's `ended` event, deliberately: a clip that
   404s, a device that refused to start playback, and a backgrounded tab all
   leave `ended` unfired, and the game must never sit waiting for audio that is
   not coming. Waiting on whatever is speaking now rather than on one particular
   utterance is what lets a child tap the caption for a repeat without stranding
   the level -- the repeat extends the wait instead of cancelling what follows.
